# rollout

## Note

I feel kind of bad about squatting on the nice [rollout](https://crates.io/crates/rollout) name on crates.io, so if you're interested in claiming it, just get in touch and I'll happily hand it over to you.

## About

An abandoned feature flipper library with the goal of being compatible
with the ruby library [fetlife/rollout](https://github.com/fetlife/rollout).

## Development

* `cargo test`
